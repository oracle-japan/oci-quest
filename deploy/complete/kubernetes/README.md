# Deploy in Kubernetes

> Note: The preferable deployment option is using Helm Charts or Resource Manager Stack. The Kubernetes manifests do not perform some of the actions needed (need manual interaction), and is not updated often like the Helm Charts. Is left here for reference and to review the manifests generated by the helm charts.

## Deploy using Helm Chart

Refer to [helm-chart](../helm-chart/README.md)

---

> If you decide to deploy using the plain kubernetes manifests (Generated from the Helm Charts), follow the instructions bellow:

## Prerequisites

### Install Ingress Controller

> NOTE: There are several options for ingress controllers in K8S. This demo uses the common `ingress-nginx`

```text
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/mandatory.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/cloud-generic.yaml
```

## Deploy

### Create Runtime in K8S

```text
kubectl apply -f mushop.yaml
```

> Verify with `kubectl get po`

## Expose

### Option A: kubectl port-forward

Best for testing deployments on a single cluster without host-specific ingress
rules. This exposes the edge service on `localhost` where `kubectl` is executed.

```text
kubectl port-forward svc/edge 8000:80
```

Open browser [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000);

### Option B: K8S Ingress

Better for development environments with nginx ingress controller installed.
This involves creating the Ingress defined within `ingress/mushop-dev.yaml`

```text
kubectl apply -f ingress/mushop-dev.yaml
```

The application will become available on [https://localhost](https://localhost)
_(with self-signed SSL)_
