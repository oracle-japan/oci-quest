## MuShop

MuShop is a microservices demo application **purpose-built** to showcase
interoperable [Cloud Native](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/) services on
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/), and to demonstrate
a number of cloud native methodologies.

The premise of MuShop is an e-commerce website offering a variety of cat
products. It represents a polyglot microservices application, with **actual use case**
scenarios for many Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

Each microservice in MuShop is designed to highlight its own, or common high-level
subject in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, using the context of the overall demo application.
